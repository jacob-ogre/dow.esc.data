Description: The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requests that federal 
    agencies and states report their expenditures on species listed under the
    US Endangered Species Act (ESA) each year. There is no differentiation
    between expenditures on compliance (e.g., section 7) and recovery actions.
    FWS then compiles a report of expenditures that they provide to Congress
    and the public. This dataset includes "Table 1" (non-land expenditures)
    from the 2008-2013 annual expenditure reports.

    FWS_tot: Total spending on the year+species+population by FWS
    other_fed: Total spending on the year+species+population by other federal
        agencies that reported expenditures to FWS
    Fed_tot: Sum of FWS_tot and other_fed
