# DOW ESC data

A repository for DESCRIPTION.yml files for data collected and curated by the
Endangered Species Conservation (ESC) department at Defenders of Wildlife (DOW).

## data/

Because git doesn't do data diffs, [dat](https://github.com/datproject/) is not 
yet mature (enough for us), and we are not a huge team, we are sharing data
with Google Drive. 

Eek! Git + a synced drive! Except that we don't sync `.git/` or any of the data
files
