Description: Under section 7 of the the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), 
    Federal agencies are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
    Service (FWS) and/or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) if an agency 
    action will affect one or more listed species. Since 2008, FWS has tracked 
    basic data about their consultations in the Tracking And Integrated Logging
    System (TAILS) database. In laste 2014, FWS provided a copy of most TAILS 
    variables (excluding protected data) to Defenders of Wildlife. We checked
    and cleaned the data, analyzed it, and published the results in December,
    2015. We update the data on a semi-regular basis as FWS provides new data.
